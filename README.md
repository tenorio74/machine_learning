# machine_learning

There are two projects included in this repository.  They are to be executed in the google colaboratory environment. 

The Pokemon Classifier is an implementation of a deep convolutional neural network.  My goal is to put in a pokemon image and the network would output the number of the pokemon it classifies it as.  The input image would not be a clean pokemon image but it could be a image of a pokemons face on a shirt, a toy, etc.
